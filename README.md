In this project we are going to make the classic game spongeBope with JavaScript on a HTML canvas.
Best of all we will code everything from scratch starting with an empty project.

In this classic game we have our enemies(Burgers) at the top of the screen; they move side to side and down towards our player..
At the bottom of the screen we have our spongeBope which can shoot at the enemies . 
Unlike the original game our bullets shoot much faster, which also makes the game much more fun. The objective is to stay alive,
avoid the enemies bullets and eliminate the enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen.

We will cover the following topics and more:
Game loop
Keyboard input
Moving our enemies
Collision detection
Shooting bullets
Game audio
